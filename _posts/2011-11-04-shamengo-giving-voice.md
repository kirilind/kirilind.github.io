They  are people who have come upon incredible ideas; people who do  something for their community and environment. People who care  about themselves, others and the Earth; people who are not  afraid – they might have started small and found a lot of resistance,  but kept going and turned out into something big. Or maybe they don't  stop just because they love what they do. They are the people portrayed  by <strong>Catherine Berthillier</strong> and her Shamengo program.</p>

###Different cultures, same values

<p>Catherine  came upon the idea of Shamengo while working as an investigative  journalist for French television and travelling the world, putting her  life in the line for the messages she wanted to convey. Visiting many  cultures and countries, she noticed that even though the language, food  and customs might be very different from her own, people still share  some similar values everywhere around the globe, have some common  concerns and are interested in similar topics, as well as strange and  innovative ideas from other lands. Catherine's thought was to create a new  program based on stories of humans who better the world through positive  action.<br> <br>Although  at first she couldn't find any supporters to her idea, she just started  to work. "I thought that I don't want to get retired and say: for my  whole life I have remained in the consumer society, been selfish and not  been part of those new values forming all around the world. I wanted to  be part of this new world."<br> <br>One by one she gathered a brave crew of six talented young professionals  willing to work for a tiny salary in the name of the good cause and  hopes for a better future. They started off with no office, travelling the world, doing interviews and finishing with the editing work in Catherine's kitchen. <br><br>“If Shamengo becomes a success,” says Catherine, “it will be because all of  us; because this is a team. And this is what I like very much –  becoming stronger together.”</p><h3>Shamengo and Let's do it!</h3><p>One  day Catherine came upon a small article mentioning the Let's do it  cleanup day in Estonia, and became interested immediately. She didn't  feel very hopeful in her quest to contact Rainer Nolvak, expecting him  to be a big star after having organised such a huge event and,  therefore, inaccessible: "It was a big surprise to me that he was so  kind and open-minded, very humble and generous of his time and excited  about the idea to be one of Shamengo pioneers. "</p><p><a href="http://youtu.be/-DBHd5chcZo" title="http://youtu.be/-DBHd5chcZo">http://youtu.be/-DBHd5chcZo</a></p><p>Wishing  to get coverage of the real hands-on action, but having missed the  original Estonian event in 2008, Shamengo team went to film the big  cleanup-day in Moldova, in April 2011. Upon learning about the World  Cleanup 2012 plans, they decided to participate in the regional  conference in Ghana, in September 2011, as well.</p><p><a href="http://youtu.be/0L0UhPc9XCs" title="http://youtu.be/0L0UhPc9XCs"></a></p><div class="eminline-wrapper"><div class="emvideo emvideo-video emvideo-youtube"><iframe id="media-youtube-html5-1" title="YouTube video player" class="media-youtube-html5" type="text/html" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0L0UhPc9XCs?hd=1" frameborder="0" height="350" width="640"></iframe><a href="http://youtu.be/0L0UhPc9XCs" title="http://youtu.be/0L0UhPc9XCs">

</div></div><h3>Clean-tagging the streets of Paris</h3></a><p><a href="http://youtu.be/0L0UhPc9XCs" title="http://youtu.be/0L0UhPc9XCs">By  October 2011, the Shamengo team – now with 8 members – having published  30 portraits and recorded material for the rest of the year, planned  the official launch of the </a><a href="http://www.shamengo.com/" target="_blank">www.shamengo.com</a> website. Catherine didn’t want to have an ordinary party.  As some of Shamengo pioneers make art by clean-tagging, she thought it  would be fun to use the same method to "tag" Shamengo logo, slogan and  website address on the crosswalks of Paris.<br> <br>Besides  the volunteers from Paris and around, the one-of-the-kind event was  attended by several Shamengo pioneers – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khxTqkP3GyQ" target="_blank">Dr Bindeshwar Pathak</a> from India,  the creator of eco-friendly sanitary toilets; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PHppmhpnI" target="_blank">Valérie Pache</a>, a fashion  designer who makes wedding gowns out of discarded paragliding sails and  was wearing one of her dresses while tagging around Opéra; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAJnbrvwwk" target="_blank">Jérôme  Salomé</a>, the creator of "Men in skirts" website and community, as well as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DBHd5chcZo" target="_blank"> Rainer Nôlvak</a> from Let’s do it! World.<br> <br>The  night started around 7pm with people gathering and learning the  clean-tagging machinery tricks ; from there on teams in some dozen cars  proceeded to tag in different locations all over Paris. Despite several  technical problems the night went very well, culminating with a 6am  breakfast at Point Éphémère, a famous culture club by Saint-Martin  canal, where the last brave volunteers – sleepy, cold, wet and  exhausted, but happy – could have their share of coffee, croissants and  other goods before going home.<br><br><em>The aftermath video of Clean Tag Night (in French, with English subtitles) </em> <br><a href="http://youtu.be/Bjp6znnJvv0" title="http://youtu.be/Bjp6znnJvv0"></a></p><div class="eminline-wrapper"><div class="emvideo emvideo-video emvideo-youtube"><iframe id="media-youtube-html5-3" title="YouTube video player" class="media-youtube-html5" type="text/html" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Bjp6znnJvv0?hd=1" frameborder="0" height="350" width="640"></iframe><a href="http://youtu.be/Bjp6znnJvv0" title="http://youtu.be/Bjp6znnJvv0">

Even after 3 years of explaining and searching, many  possible sponsors and corporations seem still suspicious, claiming that  the public wants to see war and disasters rather than happy people  making positive changes happen. But Catherine still believes in her  project. “We  want to continue with the collections, to have a new portrait each  week, but also to follow up the stories and create longer documentaries.  It’s not history. All our pioneers are alive and very active and it is  very interesting to follow their adventures.”<br><br>In  the end, it is up to every single person how to lead their life and  what choices to make. Shamengo hopes to pitch in there with the four  values explained on their website; in order to help – just like its  pioneers – to create a better world.<br><br>"Actually  it’s a very buddhist concept," says Catherine thoughtfully. "To take  care of yourself, to create with ethics, to preserve the planet, and to  help the others. And if you devote your time to do this kind of things, I  guess you can be a happy person."</p><p>This is the real goal of Shamengo, because the tagline reads: <strong>inspire your life</strong>.</p></a><p><a href="http://youtu.be/Bjp6znnJvv0" title="http://youtu.be/Bjp6znnJvv0"></a><a href="/system/files/uploads/shamengo-logo.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="Shamengo - inspire your life"><img src="/system/files/resize/uploads/shamengo-logo-640x155.jpg" alt="Shamengo - inspire your life" title="Shamengo - inspire your life" height="155" width="640"></a></p><h3>Shamengo portraits and clips on Let's do it! movement</h3><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF0AD3107704D8604" target="_blank">View the Shamengo - Let's do it! playlist in YouTube</a></p><p><em><br>Shamengo creates all their portraits in two languages : French and English. </em><br><em>Follow them on Facebook: Shamengo <a href="http://www.facebook.com/shamengo1">English page</a> ; <a href="http://www.facebook.com/shamengo">page français</a></em><br><em>YouTube: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/Shamengo2">English channel</a> ; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/Shamengo1">chaîne français</a></em><br><em> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/shamengo">Shamengo on Twitter</a> (en/fr)</em></p><p><em>Text and photos by Auli Kütt.
